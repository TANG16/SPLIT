This is the MATLAB code for the following paper: 

Multiplicative Feature Decomposition for Multi-View Multi-Task Sparse Learning. 
A submission to the 28th International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. 



Please run 'demo.m' to demonstrate the multiplicative decomposition by SPLIT on a synthetic dataset.

Please run 'demo_exp.m' to show how SPLIT performs on a multi-view multi-task dataset.

For more information on SPLIT, please type 'help SPLIT_train' or 'help SPLIT_test' under MATLAB prompt.
